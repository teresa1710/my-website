  As a mentor and academic advisor, I successfully guided four students through their
  graduation projects (thesis) at UNIMET, focusing on Data Lake and Big Data
  implementations. By providing hands-on mentorship and technical guidance, I effectively
  bridged the collaboration between the university and Akdemia, ensuring both students
  achieved their academic goals while developing practical skills using the AWS platform.
